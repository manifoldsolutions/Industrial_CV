    \section{Publications}    

    %\vspace{5pt}
    
      \noindent I have 24 peer-reviewed publications in
      mathematics (15), cognitive science (3) and robotics (6).
      I am regularly invited to write
      popular articles on mathematics, math and art, math and AI. For more details
      see my \href{https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5197-5017}{\underline{ORCID-profile}}.
     
      $\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Fast and precise writer of technical reports. 
      Proficient at structuring text and communicating complex ideas
      in a short and concise way.}\\
      $\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Creative problem solver.}

    \section{Teaching and outreach}    

     Lectured total of 14 courses on pure math, computer science, and AI, many of which I authored 100~\% myself. I have supervised many BSc, MSc, and PhD students. I am regularly invited as a lecturer and/or panel member.
     I have been interviewed on Finnish radio and newspapers.
     
      $\Rightarrow$ \textbf{Great public speaking skills.
      Excellent at explaining complex topics to a wide and diverse audience. Know how to put complex ideas in an accessible graphic and verbal format.}

        in \\ financial \& gaming industries}
    \end{twentyshort}
  

    \section{ML \& AI Experience}    
   
     I have lectured four self-authored courses on mathematics
     of machine learning covering topics from ICA, Boltzmann machines, and 
     Hopfield networks to math of backpropagation, and theory of supervised 
     \& reinforcement learning. 

     \vspace{5pt}

     In consulting jobs I have used \texttt{Python} to write
     DL algorithms using mainly \texttt{Tensorflow} for everything from
     image recognition and generation, to reinforcement learning.
